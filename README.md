# tmux

My personal tmux config WIP

## Installation instructions

- on arch based systems, clone this repo into .config file and everything should ust work.
- ~~on ubuntu based systems, if tmux is downloaded using apt, the version is 3.0 and requires the config file to be in the $HOME directory  
use the below command to mv the file to the correct location~~

```
mv ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```

## To do:

- [ ] work on documentation
